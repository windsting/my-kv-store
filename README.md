A project to provide your own FREE online key-value storage API.

Please refer to the document page for

## Why

Inspired by [Free Online Key Value store](https://keyvalue.immanuel.co). Back then I was looking for a free online key-value storage service for a hobby project. The project is a [Userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for a forum, which need to persist some user generated data. But the quota provided by above service is not enough, which is:

> (yourkey - maxlength = 64, yourvalue = maxlength = 1024)

Since the concept is not too complicated, I decided to implement it myself.
